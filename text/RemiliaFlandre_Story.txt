Remilia: "If the master of the Scarlet Devil Mansion is seen wearing cute clothes, that would bother Sakuya, wouldn't it? I think I'll wear something a little more majestic."

//Remilia: "走吧芙兰我们可要拿出馆主的威严，破例在今天好好的视察一下馆内的工作情况呢。"

Remilia: "Come, Flan, we shall exercise our duty as the majestic lords of the mansion and investigate this unsightly exception today in our magnificent mansion."

//Flandre: "姐姐现在的着装也能勉强算一个红白解决异变了吧？"

Flandre: "Sister, the dress you're wearing now makes you look like that red and white problem-solver, huh?"

//Remilia: "可不是解决异变哦芙兰，一切都是因为命运。"

//Remilia: "不是都说了老年人太激动了对身体不好嘛？你也太激动了，不过总算恢复"

Remilia: "Well don't they say that it's bad for an old person's body to get too excited? You're too excited, but you've at least recovered, right, Patchy?"

//Flandre: "呼吸机！呼吸机！！！！"

Flandre: "Ventilator! Ventilator!!!"

After Midboss #2
---------------

//Meiling: "对不起！我以为大小姐和妹妹大人也被那东西感染到梦游了！"

Meiling: "I'm sorry! I thought mistress and young mistress were infected with that sleepwalking thing!"

//Remilia: "你居然没事，因为没睡着？果然白天打盹儿是因为夜猫子属性嘛，看样子可以给你安排全日制……不…加上全年无休呢！"

Remilia: "You think this is alright because you're not actually asleep? Of course, you might nap during the day but we're lucky this predator lurks in the night, it seems you can arrange for a full-time…no, an endless, year-round position!

//Meiling: "大小姐……不是这样的，您和妹妹大人来之前就有一些精神恍惚的妖怪和馆内的女仆像梦游一样四处游荡，所以我才睡不着的啊。"

Meiling: "Mistress… that's not what I mean, before you and the young mistress came, the mansion's maids and several unconscious youkai started wandering around as if they were sleepwalking, so I couldn't sleep."

//Remilia: "……好吧，，帕奇在馆内休息，我和芙兰去调查一下，洋馆就拜托你和咲夜了。走吧芙兰"

Remilia: "…Okay, Patchy is resting in the library, Flan and I shall investigate further, and I request both you and Sakuya to stay in the mansion. Let's go, Flan."

//Flandre: "欸嘿嘿~你不是我的野餐临时冰点储存机吗，怎么变成活体烤架啦。"

Flandre: "Ehehe~ You're not my picnic thermos, are you? How about becoming my grill?"

//Remilia: "按照惯例不是应该做噩梦吗？难道因为这家伙是笨蛋？反而变成了中二病。"

Remilia: "Following the pattern, should you not be having a nightmare? Is it because this child is stupid? Or maybe she's become ill."

//Flandre: "快让我把你也变成甜点吧，加上咲夜特制的草莓炼乳，酸酸甜甜的。"

Flandre: "Let me turn you into a dessert, then I'll add some of Sakuya's specially made strawberry condensed milk! it's sweet and sour!"

//Flandre: "接下来我们去哪里呢姐姐大人，要不去看看博丽的巫女那里？"

Flandre: "Where will be go next, big sister? Want to go see the Hakurei shrine maiden?"

//Remilia: "不用了，居然能让这种笨蛋也变得异常，命运已经告诉我该去哪里了。"

Remilia: "We don't need to, actually fate this idiot has become abnormal, and fate has told me where we should go next."

//Flandre: "我倒是更喜欢异常的笨蛋呢，更加的结实，美味且有趣-V-"

Chen: "Hey that's cheating! You cheated! Two versus one isn't even fair!"

//Remilia: "既然觉得不公平就自己退下吧，叫你的主人来，哦不对，是主人的主人吧。"

Remilia: "You can quit since it's not fair, or you can call your master over- or better yet- your master's master."

//Ran: "橙，你做的很好"

Ran: "Chen, you've done very well."

//Remilia: "听说狐狸的迷惑能力很强，不过对我没用哦~还是说？要我用油豆腐收买你？"

Remilia: "I've heard a fox's ability to confuse is very strong, but it'll be useless compared to me~ wouldn't you say? Shall I buy the fox with cooking oil and tofu?"

//Flandre: "呐呐姐姐大人，九条尾巴的'目'是一起让它坏掉好呢还是一个接一个的坏掉好呢？"

Flandre: "Hey, hey, big sister, the 'eye' of the nine tails, should be break them off all at once, or should we break them off one by one?"

//Remilia: "那么好的皮毛坏掉真可惜，芙兰，要好好瞄准尾巴根部哦。"

Remilia: "It would be most unfortunate if such good fur were to be damaged, Flan, you need to aim for the base of the tail instead."

//Ran: "别小看人了，红色的恶魔，"

Ran: "Don't underestimate people, Scarlet Devil."

//Ran: "就凭你们见紫大人还不够格，"

Ran: "That attitude will not be enough for you to see Master Yukari."

//Ran: "我看不久天亮后，你们也只能"

Ran: "I see that soon after dawn, threats are the only things you can dish out."

Ran's Defeated
Before Boss - Yukari Yakumo
---------------

//Ran: "可恶，没想到妹妹也那么厉害……大意了……"

Ran: "Damn, I never expected Chen could stand her own against people like this…good for her…"

//Yukari: "退下吧，蓝，面对夜晚的她们还是很棘手的。"

Yukari: "Fall back, Ran, these two are still quite tricky in the dead of night."

//Remilia: "总算出现了么，可不要跟我解释，你什么都不知道哦~妖怪的贤者"

Remilia: "You finally showed up, don't bother explaining this to me, you know nothing about it~ Youkai Sage."

//Yukari: "让博丽的巫女来解决不是更好，什么时候你也和黑白老鼠一样爱管闲事了呢？"

Yukari: "It would have been better if the Hakurei Shrine Maiden solved the incident, and since when have you been as nosy as that black and white rat?"

//Remilia: "不只是我，你还对我可爱的妹妹也下手了呢，这重罪你明白吗？"

Remilia: "That's not just me, You've started it by hurting my cute little sister, that is a crime, am I clear?"

//Yukari: "你知道吗？恐惧可是可以激发最高的潜能，人也好妖怪也好，我只是对这个很有兴趣罢"

Yukari: "Did you know? Fear makes people rise to their highest potential, people are also good youkai, I am just so interested in this concept."

//Flandre: "我才不要做噩梦呢！姐姐大人别跟她废话了，把她揍回间隙里去！"

Flandre: "I don't want nightmares! Big sister, don't talk nonsense with her, beat her back into her gap!"

//Remilia: "我可没堕落到依靠做噩梦来让自己变得更强，妖怪的贤者，你的行为真是愚蠢至极。听好了，高贵的吸血鬼追求的是纯粹的强大。"

Remilia: "I shall not rely on nightmares to make myself stronger, Youkai Sage. You're acting very silly. The power that a noble vampire pursues is a pure, untainted power."

//Yukari: "果然吸血鬼也和人类一样肤浅呢，难道是因为曾经是人类？没法摆脱腐朽的想法"

Yukari: "Clearly, you vampires are as superficial as humans, is it because you used to be human yourself? You have never cast aside your decaying convictions."

//Yukari: "真是的，你就好好站在命运的长河边静静的观望吧，和你的只知晓破坏的妹妹一起。"

Yukari: "Really, now, you simply stand by the river of destiny, watching it quietly, together with your sister, whose only friend is destruction."


---------------
Mid-fight
---------------

//Yukari: "看来你们还挺能打啊，我就破例让你看看来自恐惧的力量的源头吧。"

Yukari: "It looks like you're still keeping up, I will make an exception and let you see the source of this fear power."

//Musaraku: "紫……紫小姐，为什么突然让我出现啊QAQ，那对姐妹好像会吸血唉。"

Musaraku: "Miss… Miss Yukari, why did you suddenly make me appear QAQ, these sisters look like they want to suck my blood. I'm… I'm scared!"

//Remilia: "噩梦的源头终于出现了，看起来真没用，我都怀疑的你的眼光了，紫。"

Remilia: "The source of these nightmares has finally appeared, but she seems truly useless, I truly doubt your senses, Yukari."

//Flandre: "姐姐大人，她的紫长发好美哦，真想要呐。"

Flandre: "Big sister, her long, purple hair is pretty, I want it!"

//Musaraku: "呀！！！"

Musaraku: "YAAAAH!!!"

//Yukari: "哎呀，一不小心玩过头了呢，是吧梦沙罗酱~"

Yukari: "Oh my, it seems I overplayed, haven't I, Musaraku~"

//Musaraku: "明明是紫小姐你不由分说就把我扯进来威胁我的不是吗？"

Musaraku: "Yes you have, Miss Yukari, you throw me into the battlefield just to have my life threatened, no?"

//Yukari: "我可什么都不知道哦，锅交给你了~欢迎来到幻想乡。"

Yukari: "I didn't know that would happen, I handed the reins to you~ Anyway, welcome to Gensokyo."

//Remilia: "哎呀……逃走了，嘛姑且算是事情解决了"

Remilia: "Curses… she got away, well, the incident is solved."

//Flandre: "另一个元凶还在呢姐姐大人~"

Flandre: "But the culprit is still here, big sister~"

//Musaraku: "不是我……是紫小姐她硬让我做的……"

Musaraku: "It's not me… It was Miss Yukari, she made me do it…"

//Remilia: "你知道惹怒我应该怎么赔偿吗？交给灵梦的话，可能会很经常呢~"

Remilia: "You know what would make up for how angry you've made me? If I hand you over to Reimu, you could be here for a while~"

//Flandre: "不嘛姐姐大人，让她做芙兰我的玩具吧！！！！梦沙罗酱不会让我失望吧？你肯定是一个怎么都玩不坏的好、玩、具~对吧~"

Flandre: "Nooo, big sister, make her one of Flan's toys!!!! Mengluosha won't disappoint me! You'll definitely be a fun, unbreakable tooooooy~ dollie~ right?"

//Remilia: "真拿你没办法啊，要好好跟咲夜说哦。"

Remilia: "I'm afraid I cannot do that for you, you will need to talk to Sakuya about that."

//Flandre: "是！姐姐大人！"

Flandre: "Okay! Big sister!"

//Musaraku: "紫小姐TAT……"

Musaraku: "MISS YUKARI… TAT"
