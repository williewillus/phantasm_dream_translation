Remilia: "Come, Flan, we shall make an exception and show the our prestige as majestic ladies of the mansion to examine the state of work in the mansion."

//Flandre: "姐姐现在的着装也能勉强算一个红白解决异变了吧？"

Flandre: "Sister, the outfit you're wearing now makes you kind of count as a red and white incident-solver, huh?"

//Remilia: "可不是解决异变哦芙兰，一切都是因为命运。"

//Remilia: "不是都说了老年人太激动了对身体不好嘛？你也太激动了，不过总算恢复"

Remilia: "Don't they say that it's bad for an old person's body to get too excited? You're too excited, but you've at least recovered, right, Patchy?"

//Flandre: "呼吸机！呼吸机！！！！"

Meiling: "I'm sorry! I thought mistress and young mistress were infected with that sleepwalking thing!"

//Remilia: "你居然没事，因为没睡着？果然白天打盹儿是因为夜猫子属性嘛，看样子可以给你安排全日制……不…加上全年无休呢！"

Remilia: "You're alright, because you didn't fall asleep? So you indeed are dozing off during the day to be a night owl. Looks like I can give you a full-time…no…also a whole year without rest!

//Meiling: "大小姐……不是这样的，您和妹妹大人来之前就有一些精神恍惚的妖怪和馆内的女仆像梦游一样四处游荡，所以我才睡不着的啊。"

Meiling: "Mistress… that's not what I mean, before you and the young mistress came, the mansion's maids and several dazed youkai started wandering around as if they were sleepwalking, so I couldn't sleep."

//Remilia: "……好吧，，帕奇在馆内休息，我和芙兰去调查一下，洋馆就拜托你和咲夜了。走吧芙兰"

Remilia: "…Okay, Patchy is resting in the library, Flan and I shall investigate further, and I leave the mansion to you and Sakuya. Let's go, Flan."

Flandre: "Ehehe~ Aren't you my picnic thermos? How did you become a living grill?"

//Remilia: "按照惯例不是应该做噩梦吗？难道因为这家伙是笨蛋？反而变成了中二病。"

Remilia: "Following the pattern, should you not be having a nightmare? Is it because this child is stupid? Or maybe she's become ill."

//Flandre: "快让我把你也变成甜点吧，加上咲夜特制的草莓炼乳，酸酸甜甜的。"

//Remilia: "不用了，居然能让这种笨蛋也变得异常，命运已经告诉我该去哪里了。"

Remilia: "No need, the ability to cause even this idiot to become abnormal, fate has already told me where we need to go next."

Ran: "Chen, you've done very well."

//Remilia: "听说狐狸的迷惑能力很强，不过对我没用哦~还是说？要我用油豆腐收买你？"

Remilia: "I've heard a fox's ability to confuse is very strong, but its useless on me~ wouldn't you say? Shall I pay you off with some oil tofu?"

//Flandre: "呐呐姐姐大人，九条尾巴的'目'是一起让它坏掉好呢还是一个接一个的坏掉好呢？"

Flandre: "Hey, hey, big sister, the 'eye' of the nine tails, should be break them off all at once, or should we break them off one by one?"

//Remilia: "那么好的皮毛坏掉真可惜，芙兰，要好好瞄准尾巴根部哦。"

Remilia: "It would be a shame if such good fur were to be damaged, Flan, you need to aim carefully for the base of the tail instead."

//Ran: "别小看人了，红色的恶魔，"

Ran: "Don't underestimate me, Scarlet Devil."

Before Boss - Yukari Yakumo
---------------

//Ran: "可恶，没想到妹妹也那么厉害……大意了……"

Ran: "Damn, I didn't expect even the younger sister could be this strong…I underestimated her…"

//Yukari: "退下吧，蓝，面对夜晚的她们还是很棘手的。"

Yukari: "Fall back, Ran, these two are still quite tricky to face in the dead of night."

//Remilia: "总算出现了么，可不要跟我解释，你什么都不知道哦~妖怪的贤者"

Remilia: "You finally showed up, don't bother telling me you don't know anything ~ Youkai Sage."

//Yukari: "让博丽的巫女来解决不是更好，什么时候你也和黑白老鼠一样爱管闲事了呢？"

Yukari: "Wouldn't it be better if the Hakurei Shrine Maiden came to solve the incident, since when have you been as nosy as that black and white rat?"

//Remilia: "不只是我，你还对我可爱的妹妹也下手了呢，这重罪你明白吗？"

Remilia: "Not only me, but you've attacked my cute little sister, you understand that that is a huge offense?"

//Yukari: "你知道吗？恐惧可是可以激发最高的潜能，人也好妖怪也好，我只是对这个很有兴趣罢"

Yukari: "Did you know? Fear makes people rise to their highest potential, human or youkai. I am just interested in this concept."

//Flandre: "我才不要做噩梦呢！姐姐大人别跟她废话了，把她揍回间隙里去！"

Flandre: "I don't want nightmares! Big sister, don't talk nonsense with her, beat her back into her gap!"

//Remilia: "我可没堕落到依靠做噩梦来让自己变得更强，妖怪的贤者，你的行为真是愚蠢至极。听好了，高贵的吸血鬼追求的是纯粹的强大。"

Remilia: "I haven't resorted to relying on nightmares to make myself stronger, Youkai Sage. Your actions are extremely foolish. What a noble vampire pursues is pure, untainted power."

//Yukari: "果然吸血鬼也和人类一样肤浅呢，难道是因为曾经是人类？没法摆脱腐朽的想法"

Yukari: "Clearly, you vampires are as superficial as humans, is it because you used to be human yourself? You have never cast aside your degenerate convictions."

//Yukari: "真是的，你就好好站在命运的长河边静静的观望吧，和你的只知晓破坏的妹妹一起。"

Yukari: "Really, you just stand and quietly watch the long river of destiny, along with your little sister who only knows destruction."


---------------
Mid-fight
---------------

//Yukari: "看来你们还挺能打啊，我就破例让你看看来自恐惧的力量的源头吧。"

Yukari: "It looks like you're still keeping up, I will make an exception and let you see the source of this fear power."

//Musaraku: "紫……紫小姐，为什么突然让我出现啊QAQ，那对姐妹好像会吸血唉。"

Musaraku: "Miss… Miss Yukari, why did you suddenly make me appear QAQ, these sisters look like they can suck my blood."

//Remilia: "噩梦的源头终于出现了，看起来真没用，我都怀疑的你的眼光了，紫。"

Remilia: "The source of these nightmares has finally appeared, but she seems useless. I doubt your eye for potential, Yukari."

//Flandre: "姐姐大人，她的紫长发好美哦，真想要呐。"

Flandre: "Big sister, her long, purple hair is pretty, I want it!"

//Musaraku: "呀！！！"

Musaraku: "YAAAAH!!!"

After Boss

//Yukari: "哎呀，一不小心玩过头了呢，是吧梦沙罗酱~"

Yukari: "Oh my, it seems I've overplayed, haven't I, Musaraku~"

//Musaraku: "明明是紫小姐你不由分说就把我扯进来威胁我的不是吗？"

Musaraku: "But you were the one who threw me in here without explanation to threaten me, Miss Yukari?"

//Yukari: "我可什么都不知道哦，锅交给你了~欢迎来到幻想乡。"

Yukari: "I don't know anything, the blame is yorus now~ welcome to Gensokyo."

//Remilia: "哎呀……逃走了，嘛姑且算是事情解决了"

Remilia: "Curses… she got away, well, I guess we can consider the incident resolved."

//Flandre: "另一个元凶还在呢姐姐大人~"

Flandre: "But the other culprit is still here, big sister~"

//Musaraku: "不是我……是紫小姐她硬让我做的……"

Musaraku: "It's not me… It was Miss Yukari, she made me do it…"

//Remilia: "你知道惹怒我应该怎么赔偿吗？交给灵梦的话，可能会很经常呢~"

Remilia: "Do you know how you should make up for how angry you've made me? If I handed you over to Reimu, you could be here for a while~"

//Flandre: "不嘛姐姐大人，让她做芙兰我的玩具吧！！！！梦沙罗酱不会让我失望吧？你肯定是一个怎么都玩不坏的好、玩、具~对吧~"

Flandre: "Nooo, big sister, let her be one of Flan's toys!!!! Musaraku-chan won't disappoint me, will she! You'll definitely be a fun, unbreakable tooooooy~ right?"

//Remilia: "真拿你没办法啊，要好好跟咲夜说哦。"

Remilia: "What will I do with you, we'll need to talk to Sakuya about this."

//Flandre: "是！姐姐大人！"

Flandre: "Okay! Big sister!"

//Musaraku: "紫小姐TAT……"

Musaraku: "MISS YUKARI… TAT"
