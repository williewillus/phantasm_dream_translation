//Rinnosuke: "嗯？您在想什么？"

Rinnosuke: "Hm? What are you thinking about?"

//Reimu: "没什么，我还有些事要处理，天子就拜托你了"

Reimu: "Nothing, I have a lot of business to attend to, and it seemed that Tenshi just pleased you."

//Rinnosuke: "好的，可是……额……走掉了啊，真是的从来不听人好好吧话说完。真是个急性子呢，与其这样不明就里的找下去，还不如去问问那位大人。"

Rinnosuke: "Okay, but… ugh… go away, I was never actually listening until you finished talking. You're such an acute child, and if you're going to look for it in that way, it's better to go ask that person."

//Kaguya: "藤原家的小姑娘终究还是小姑娘，竟然会因为噩梦而失去心智，哼~算了，终究是我的梦，博丽的巫女啊，你愿意听我说一点闲话吗？"

Kaguya: "The little Fujiwara girl is, after all, still a mere child, and I'm going to lose my mind because of this nightmare she put me through, oh~ I see, this IS a dream. Hakurei Shrine Maiden, did you intend to eavesdrop while I talked in my sleep?"

//Reimu: "你说吧？【为何今天感觉那么脱力- -】"

Reimu: "What?" (Why is everything so off today- -)

//Kaguya: "如果一个人拥有永久的生命，那她会抱着这样的心态活下去呢？"

Kaguya: "If someone pursues eternal life, this is the kind of mentality they are left with."

//Reimu: "呃……嗯……不知道……？"

Kaguya: "Well it seems this really was not a dream after all."

//Reimu: "你……"

Reimu: "You…"

//Kaguya: "我早就说过，对于时刻生活在噩梦中的人，噩梦什么的，有什么好可怕的呢？博丽的巫女，我问你，是不是来寻求解决之道的"

Kaguya: "A long time ago I once thought, 'for those who are living nightmares, what is the nightmare, and what makes it fearful?' I ask you, have you come to seek the answer to that question?"

//Reimu: "一开始是，现在只想把精神病退治掉，这样我就清静了"

Reimu: "Once I started, yes, but now I can only think of defeating you, and then I shall be at peace."

//Kaguya: "接下来你该怎么做呢？如果不快一点，说不定黑白的魔法使又要抢先了"

Kaguya: "What shall you do now? If you do not act fast, the black and white magician could be the first to solve the incident."

//Reimu: "呵呵，她说不定在做偷东西被抓住的噩梦吧，让她平时给我添麻烦来着。我已经知道是哪个麻烦的家伙搞的鬼了"

Reimu: "Aah, She might even end up stealing the nightmares away, she's always giving me trouble! I already know the person who could cause this kind of incident."

//Kaguya: "哦？你那么肯定？"

Kaguya: "Oh? And how can you be so sure?"

Reimu: "What is that, what are you saying?

//Yukari: "你知道吗？噩梦是这个世界上最能唤起内心深处，平时掩盖着的恐惧，的事物，想想看，那么多真实的恐惧，多么令人兴奋啊！"

Yukari: "Do you know? Nightmares are the best evokers of inner self this world has to offer. So many fearful things, as you have seen. So many authentic insecurities. How exciting!"

//Yukari: "把这些恐惧放到阳光下，让所有人知道并且正视他们，我觉得我真是个伟大的圣人。"

Yukari: "If you put these fears in broad daylight, it will help everyone truly face their fears. I think that clearly makes me rather saintly."
